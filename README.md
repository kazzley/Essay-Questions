- 1. Why are you interested in programming? What have you done to expose yourself to programming so far?

I've had a long interest in programing and web design since I was in high school.    I started taking Multimedia classes the first year that they were offered, as a way to earn both an art and technology credit for graduation.  I continued my education focus around front end multimedia design, earning both my associate's and bachelor's degrees in the field.  While I'm passionate about visual design, I recognize the role that programming plays into the overall experience that a user has with an application.  My higher education programs focused more on content than the back end, leaving me to feel inadequately prepared to enter a technology related field.  I'm hoping to fill those gaps by joining this program, making me a well rounded applicant to the industry.  It's been a while, but I have experience with HTML, Actionscript, Javascript and have been exposed to other programing languages.  I believe my background has given me a good understanding of programing language structure and syntax.  I've also participated in websites like Code Academy, just for fun.

- 2. What are your professional goals for the next 2 years, the next 5 years?

Contingent of participation in the ADA Academy, I'd like to see myself working for a highly regarded company in a development role.  Ideally, I'd like to be in a position to expose myself to a wide variety of projects so I can continue to build upon my skills.  5 years down the line, I'd love to be able to utilize my leadership skills to become a project manager.

- 3. Tell us about a time you made a mistake that you learned a lot from. If you encountered the situation again, what would you do differently?

I made a mistake in my current role when I first started with the company.  An employee had injured their wrist and I mishandled the situation when they approached me about it.  I was on my own for the first time and basically panicked and sent the employee out of the building instead of calling a contracted medical service for support.  I also neglected to put in a report about it, which could have put us out of OSHA compliance.  I realize now that I should have reached out for help from one of my peers prior to giving direction to the employee, because I was severely unsure of what I was supposed to be doing.  This event pushed me to be more comfortable asking questions and seeking assistance from others.

- 4. Have you taught yourself anything before? Describe what you learned and how you approached it.

I taught myself how to partition a hard drive and install a Linux operating system.  My last year in college, my final group project involved creating an IOS app that would be submitted to the Apple App Store.  Only one of our group members had an Apple computer but it was so old, they couldn't install the app building software on it.  By the time we realized that we couldn't rely on that group member to compile the app, I had to research solutions and think outside the box to get the project done by the deadline.  I ended up having to work backwards in a way, first trying to solve for installing the app building program on a Window's machine.  Then, I broke each step of the process down into different components and researched and complied requirements for each step.  Once I was ready, I implemented my strategy and was ultimately able to build the app myself and get it submitted for the project deadline.
